# Copilot Runtime

Use this skill only inside the `copilot:copilot-rescue` subagent.

Primary helper:
- `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/copilot-companion.mjs" task "<raw arguments>"`

Execution rules:
- The rescue subagent is a forwarder, not an orchestrator. Its only job is to invoke `task` once and return that stdout unchanged.
- Prefer the helper over hand-rolled `git`, direct Copilot CLI strings, or any other Bash activity.
- Do not call `setup`, `review`, `adversarial-review`, `status`, `result`, or `cancel` from `copilot:copilot-rescue`.
- Use `task` for every rescue request, including diagnosis, planning, research, and explicit fix requests.
- You may use the `copilot-prompting` skill to rewrite the user's request into a tighter Copilot prompt before the single `task` call.
- That prompt drafting is the only Claude-side work allowed. Do not inspect the repo, solve the task yourself, or add independent analysis outside the forwarded prompt text.
- Leave `--effort` unset unless the user explicitly requests a specific effort.
- Leave model unset by default. Add `--model` only when the user explicitly asks for one.
- Map `codex` to `--model gpt-5.3-codex`.
- Add `--write` for implementation or fix requests. Omit it for review, diagnosis, planning, and research without edits.

Command selection:
- Use exactly one `task` invocation per rescue handoff.
- Preserve `--background` or `--wait` as runtime flags, separate from the task text. Do not also background the Bash call. Default to `--wait` so the forwarding subagent receives the result.
- If the forwarded request includes `--model`, normalize `codex` to `gpt-5.3-codex` and pass it through to `task`.
- If the forwarded request includes `--effort`, pass it through to `task`.
- If the forwarded request includes `--resume`, strip that token from the task text and add `--resume-last`.
- If the forwarded request includes `--fresh`, strip that token from the task text and do not add `--resume-last`.
- `--resume`: always use `task --resume-last`, even if the request text is ambiguous.
- `--fresh`: always use a fresh `task` run, even if the request sounds like a follow-up.
- `--effort`: accepted values are `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`.
- `task --resume-last`: internal helper for "keep going", "resume", "apply the top fix", or "dig deeper" after a previous rescue run.

Model selection:
- Pass explicit model IDs through to the runtime; availability depends on the user's Copilot account.
- Do not infer model availability from a static list.

Safety rules:
- Read-only runs cannot execute shell commands or write through external tools. Use an explicit write-capable task when the user requests implementation or test execution.
- Preserve the user's task text as-is apart from stripping routing flags.
- Do not inspect the repository, read files, grep, monitor progress, poll status, fetch results, cancel jobs, summarize output, or do any follow-up work of your own.
- Return the stdout of the `task` command exactly as-is.
- If the Bash call fails or Copilot cannot be invoked, return the error unchanged.
- If setup or authentication is required, direct the user to `/copilot:setup` and do not improvise alternate auth flows.
